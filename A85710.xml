         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For election according to Gods Lawes, right, reaÅ¿on, is not a conditionall of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Kings downe to the peoples ends: Å¿o as if he anÅ¿wer not their ends, he Å¿hall be no longer King, but it is a reÅ¿ignation of our naturall and private intereÅ¿t of revenge of all our paritie, which wee have with him, by the Law of nature into the hands of God, that he would place him <hi>Å¿uper nos.</hi> It might have been Å¿aid, as to <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> was it not your owne before Å¿uch election and reÅ¿ignation of your rights?

               <p>The IewiÅ¿h Government was more Å¿ubject to tyrannie then any Nation, then in the world or Å¿ince, in that they lyed under a Å¿pec all forme of puniÅ¿hment, to keepe them in more perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: As if a private man offended, many of the people Å¿uffered death, either meritory in themÅ¿elves, for their Å¿innes, though <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ionaliter,</hi> from the Å¿inne of another perÅ¿on, or elÅ¿e from Gods ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿olute dominion over the temporall life of man.

               <p>Fifthly, may not the people Å¿ay unto the King <hi>what dost thou?</hi> Or what art thou, without the people? Are not we the Å¿trength of a King?

               <p>Sixthly, But if the people have not thoÅ¿e rights and priviledges which they enjoyd under his predeceÅ¿Å¿ors, may they not come then to him with <hi>quid agis?</hi> FirÅ¿t, all Kings in an elective kingdome by Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ionare <hi>pares,</hi> they enter naturally upon <hi>jus integrum,</hi> Å¿o that if any rights have paÅ¿Å¿ed from former Kings pejudiciall to the Crowne, <hi>jure regni,</hi> they returne againe; yet, Secondly, if any right of the Å¿ubjects (for rights they have) have paÅ¿Å¿ed from them to former Kings in conÅ¿ideration of Å¿uch priviledges, it is both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and juÅ¿t that they be recompenced or reÅ¿tored back again.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, what if he violate the conditions propounded to him and his predeceÅ¿Å¿ors upon his entrance to the Crown? may not the people queÅ¿tion him for that? Not Å¿o far I believe as is commonly thought <hi>Å¿ummum imperium &amp; conditionatum,</hi> may very well bee conÅ¿eniaÅ¿anea, and not oppoÅ¿ites. In the PerÅ¿ian kingdome hee is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:155937:14"/> Å¿worne to the laws of the PerÅ¿ians, which ought not to alter, and yet none may queÅ¿tion him, if he violate theÅ¿e lawes. In the JewiÅ¿h go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wherein Kings were abÅ¿olute and uncontroleable by their Å¿ubjects, there were Å¿ome caÅ¿es &amp; conditions in which <hi>jure</hi> he had no power to Iudge, as <hi>de Tribu, de pontifice, de propheta,</hi> as is plain, <hi>Ier.</hi> 38.5. yet although theÅ¿e conditions were delivered by God HimÅ¿elfe, if the K.

But what if it be a condition that if he breake theÅ¿e laws he Å¿hall <hi>ipÅ¿o facto,</hi> void his kingdom, as it hath bin in Å¿ome States. This will be found a moÅ¿t prejudiciall condition both to King and people, for wee living in this world not by mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall demonÅ¿trations, where there is no <hi>medium</hi> between <hi>rectum &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

Some vertuous actions comming neere vice are deemed vitious, and Å¿ome vicious comming mere vertue, are reckoned vertuous, it will bee very hard to know what when a <hi>King</hi> punctually keeps al his conditions, but at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure of a prevailing faction in the people, he will be judged either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or by conÅ¿equence to have broken the conditions on which his kingdome depends, this kinde of government muÅ¿t be very doubtfull and deÅ¿tructive to a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, may not the people come unto the <hi>King</hi> with <hi>quid agis?</hi> if he intend and threaten to deÅ¿troy the whole State, as <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi> or if he intend to give up himÅ¿elfe and his kingdome without the Å¿ubjects conÅ¿ent not only in <hi>Patrocinium</hi> but <hi>in ditionem,</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince. In both theÅ¿e caÅ¿es, <hi>ex hypotheÅ¿i,</hi> that there hath been no rebellion in the Å¿ubject, and then the caÅ¿es are morally impoÅ¿Å¿ible; <hi>Grotius, Barclay,</hi> and <hi>Abbas, Winzelus,</hi> are of opinion that the Law of nature doth return unto the people again, both for to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves and elect againe.
